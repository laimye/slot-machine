		<h2>WINNING COMBINATIONS AND CALCULATION</h2>
		<p>
			First thing you need to know, in case you decide to calculate the probability of you winning the game, is that you will be playing 7 symbols. Each symbol has a <strong>ranking</strong> and depending on that your winnings will be calculated. When you hit a winning combination, winnings will be added to the <strong>Balance</strong> meter. The <strong>Game is Over</strong> when your balance equals or less than 4.
		</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Ranking</strong> - points associated with the ranking of the symbol (see above). <br>
				<strong>Level</strong> - There are two winning levels:<br>
				- 3 - when you get a winning combination of three of the same symbol in a row.<br>
				- 2 - when you get a winning combination of three of the same symbol in a row. Keep in mind, the matching symbols should be right next to each other.<br>
				<strong>Bet</strong> - The Bet that you selected. By default the Bet is set to 20. <br><br>
